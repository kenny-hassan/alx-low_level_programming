0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

0. isupper
A function that checks for uppercase character.
Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
Returns 1 if c is uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise

1. isdigit
A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a digit
Returns 0 otherwise

2-mul.c
A function that multiplies two integers.
Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

3-print_numbers.c
A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_numbers(void);

4-print_most_numbers.c: I believe in numbers and signs
A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
Do not print 2 and 4

5-more_numbers.c: Numbers constitute the only universal language
A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14,
followed by a new line.
Prototype: void more_numbers(void);

6-print_line.c: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
Prototype: void print_line(int n);
Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed

7-print_diagonal.c: I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);

8-print_square.c: You are so much sunshine in every square inch
A function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_square(int size);
Where size is the size of the square
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the square

9-fizz_buzz.c
The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the
99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of
a wet paper bag.
A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line.
But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

Each number or word should be separated by a space

You are allowed to use the standard library

10-print_triangle.c
A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);
Where size is the size of the triangle
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the triangle

100-prime_factor.c: The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.
A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number
612852475143, followed by a new line.

101-print_number.c: Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper
A function that prints an integer.
Prototype: void print_number(int n);
